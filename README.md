# StrategyPatternDemo

A simple example of the Strategy Pattern using animals.

## Getting Started

Running this example is as simple as downloading the .zip, importing the project into your IDE of choice, and running it.

It was built using Eclipse, and although I haven't tested it in other IDEs I can't imagine why it wouldn't run in them.

## Built With

* [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/neon3) - The Eclipse IDE
* [Strategy Pattern â€“ Head First Design Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ejT8FO-7I) - A YoutTube video by [Christopher Okhravi](http://christopherokhravi.se/) I found to be extremely helpful for understanding this pattern.
